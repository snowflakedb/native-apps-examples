# Snowflake Native App Examples

**Note**: Snowflake CLI is in Public Preview (PuPr). You can find the official documentation and download links [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/index).

This repository contains example applications built using the [Snowflake Native App](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about) Framework. These examples have been built and are supported by Snowflake Inc., are self-contained, and can be deployed directly to your account using Snowflake CLI.

## Deploying example applications

Deploying and exploring any of the example applications available in this repository is simple. Generally speaking, the process is:

1. Ensure Snowflake CLI is installed and up-to-date
2. Clone this repository
3. Change to the example application directory of your choosing
4. Execute `snow app run` from your command line to deploy the app using your default connection

Some applications require other account-level setup before they can be properly deployed; see the individual application directories for more detailed instructions. To manage your Snowflake CLI connections, see the [Snowflake CLI documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/connecting/connect).
